Shock occurs when there is a Lack of blood flow, meaning that the cells and organs do not get enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly.;
As a result of the lack of blood flow, many organs can be damaged (deoxidized) as a result if shock continues for an extended period of time without treatment.;
Since shock is a result of exposure to extreme situations (seeing someone die, hypothermia, vomiting (dehydration), and significant blood loss, etc.), it will not be resulted from a head injury, unless blood is present.;
Excessive thirst (e.x. Dehydration from heat stroke), rapid breathing (witnessing something dramatic), and pale skin (blood loss), are all symptoms of shock, eye roll has not been proven to be a reliable symptom.;
Although in most cases the victim will recover from shock on their own with no complications, there is always a chance of their being a complication, therefore it is important for the victim to see a doctor immediately.;
Warming and putting the victim in a comfortable position is always effective as it is comforting, and it is important to monitor their airway and breathing so another complication does not occur (asthma, etc.). Performing CPR should never be done unless victim stops breathing.;
Hypothermia is a result of a drop in core internal body temperature. A person body will try to reheat itself, but when exposed to extreme cold temperatures for extended periods of time, it will continue to worsen, at which hypothermia will occur.;
Since hypothermia is a result of a drop in core body temperature, warming the victim up will assist the body in returning to the correct temperature. It is important to try and do this in anyway possible, whether it be using a blanked, putting the victim in front of a fire, etc. If the victim is wet, get their wet clothes off and replace them.;
Heat stroke is a result of an increase in core internal body temperature. A person body will try to recool itself (perspiration), but when exposed to extreme warm temperatures for extended periods of time, it will continue to worsen, at which heat stroke will eventually occur.;
Since heat stroke is a result of an increase in core body temperature, cooling the victim up will assist the body in returning to the correct temperature. It is important to try and do this in anyway possible, but not cooling them too much as they are extremely sensitive to cold at this point, meaning they could go into hypothermia. They are also dehydrated, so water also helps.;
Although heat stroke most commonly takes a few hours to get over, in very extreme situations, where immense dehydration is present, it is possible for it to be lethal. Currently in the United States, approximately 658 people die from heat stroke each year.;
