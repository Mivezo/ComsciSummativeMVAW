This is due to a poor living lifestyle, causing plaque to build up somewhere around the circulatory system. A heart attack occurs once this blockage reaches approximately 70-100% in a vein or artery. Once blood cannot be pumped by the heart to go through this blockage and send sufficient oxygen, a heart attack occurs. 
If a victim is experiencing the symptoms of a heart attack, it is actually very common for there to be denial, as a heart attack is usually as a result of a poor lifestyle (which people don't want to believe that they live). With poor circulation in a heart attack, pain/pressure and a weak but rapid pulse are also very common symptoms. Nausea is sometimes a possibility, but is usually connected to the shock involved. Vomiting almost never occurs in a heart attack.
When treating a victim with a heart attack, it is always important to not directly tell them the condition they have. This is because knowing they are having a heart attack can cause extreme panic, increasing their heart rate and worsening their condition. It is also important to loosen tight clothing so it doesn't restrict their breathing (which should also be monitored and slowed down if possible). An AED should only be used if their heart completely stops and they go unconscious.
Since aspirin is a blood thinner, this medication would help greatly in decreasing the blood clotting taking place. It is important when giving aspirin that the victim themself take it, you cannot be the one who puts it in their mouth.
Angina is not a disease in itself, but a symptom of heart disease. Attacks are caused by reduced oxygen in the blood reaching the heart, this why it is considered as �mini heart attacks�. It may present in the form of an angina attack, pain, or discomfort in the chest that typically lasts from 1 to 15 minutes. The condition is classified by the pattern of attacks into stable, unstable, and variant angina (mild, moderate, severe).
If the victim has already been diagnosed with Angina, they should have nitroglycerin pills available wherever they go. Meaning you should always ask the victim if they have angina and if they have medication. If this is the first time they are having an angina attack, treat it as a regular heart attack.
Since the symptoms of angina and a heart attack are very similar, almost the same, it is important to treat the victim in the worse case scenario of a heart attack. If the victim tells you he/she has angina, give nitroglycerin then treat similarly to a heart attack. It is important that once paramedics arrive, you tell them that the victim took X amount of their medication (so they can regulate how much they can give the victim).
A stroke is very similar to a heart attack in that it is the result of not enough oxygen getting to parts of the brain. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die. A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke).
With a stroke being able to occur in different parts of the brain for every person (which all are responsible for some type of bodily function), this can result in many different types of symptoms. The most common are functioning properties in the face (numbness, trouble speaking, sight, etc.), but sudden difficulty to breath is very rare in a stroke.
If a victim lays on the side that becomes numb when the stroke occurs, it can feel like they are floating which is uncomfortable, but they know best what is comfortable. Victims should always be treated and in any case of stroke 911 should be called. Nitroglycerin should only be given if victim has angina and has a prescription.
Even though aspirin is effective for a heart attack and even an ischemic stroke (blocked artery), it would be very dangerous for a hemorrhagic stroke (burst blood vessel). This is because giving the victim aspirin (a blood thinner) would cause more blood to seep into the brain, causing internal hemorrhaging, which puts the victim in critical condition. Since the symptoms of the two types of strokes are so similar, aspirin should never be given as it cannot be ensured that it is an ischemic stroke.
With any wound, if there are any unknown resigns they should be cleaned immediately to disallow for infection, if it is a child, the parent/guardian should be contacted as the wound is being cleaned. After that the wound should be bandaged. 911 is not called for any minor bleeds.
Arterial bleeds occur when a major artery is cut. This is because arteries bring all the fresh oxidized blood, and have a higher blood pressure than veins. As a result, it causes more blood to be lost, and does not allow fresh blood to get to the brain and heart (which is fatal). It is important to use your better judgment whether a bleed should be minor or major (how big, how much blood is being lost, bleeding is not stopping).
Although a tourniquet could be useful, you are not certified to give a tourniquet at this moment. Once you have completed you NL (National Lifeguard), only then can u begin to use tourniquets. It is important to note that if a tourniquet is used (for example an arm), it is as a last resort where life is more important than the limb (as stopping blood flow will kill the limb but the victim will not die).
It is very important that if the victim bleeds through the dressing that was previously put, that it is not removed. This is because when removing the bandage it allows for blood to flow freely again, and unclots the wound. This can cause the victim to bleed even more than before, which is why adding a new bandage on top of the previous one is the correct treatment.
