Steps to apply tourniquet: 1. Apply the tourniquet 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in.) above the injury. If there is a joint in this range, apply the tourniquet above it, at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) away from the joint. 2. Tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops. 3. Secure the tourniquet in place. 4. Document the time the tourniquet was tightened.
To perform cpr: 1. Place both of your hands on the centre of the person’s chest. Do 30 compressions: \n-Push down at least 5 cm (about 2 in.), pushing deeply and steadily. \n-Allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression (do not lean on the chest). \n-The chest compression rate should be between 100 and 120 beats per minute (30 compressions in 15 to 18 seconds).
Steps to perform rescue breaths: Give 2 rescue breaths: \n-Open the airway by doing a head-tilt/chin-lift. \n-Place your barrier device over the person’s mouth and nose. \n-If using a plastic face shield, seal your lips tightly over the person’s mouth and pinch the nose.
