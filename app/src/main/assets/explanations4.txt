 Bruising occurs when the tissue or muscle bleeds below the skin. This is usually associated with trauma (being hit, for instance). This can mostly occur anywhere on the body, but it is important to be watchful if these bruises have occured somewhere odd (e.x. The neck), which could be an injury from something else (e.x. Abuse).
 A bruise is a minor injury, so 911 should not be called unless odd symptoms begin to occur (dizziness, could have gotten concussion). The injury usually is not serious enough to be treated with shock, and the victim only needs his or her parent if their age is under 18. In general, treat by icing the injury, at a time period of 15 minutes for every hour until swelling subsides
 First-degree burns are those in which damage is restricted to the surface of the skin. First-degree burns can be quite painful; in cases such as a sunburn, these burns can also be wide spread.
 When a victim has a first degree burn, it is important the flush the burned area with cool, clean water or apply cold (not ice). You should repeat the flushing until the victim notes that the heat in the affected area has subsided. Putting the victim in a comfortable position and maintaining an open airway is always important, but calling 911 is not necessary as this does not threaten life unless it is on a small child and on the majority of their face or neck
 Second-degree burns affect the upper layers of the skin. These burns are characterized by blisters, redness, pain, and swelling. With any painful injury, this can be accompanied with shock, and also anxiety. The muscle and bone is not exposed in a second degree burn.
 It is always important to flush the burned area with cool water as this can drastically decrease the amount of pain the victim experiences. After doing so a dry sterile dressing should be applied to the wound and the victim should be treated for shock. A wet cloth should never be applied to a second degree burn as it can stick to any blisters the victim might have, meaning the blister could pop on removal (which is bad for the healing of the burn).
 Third-degree burns (also called "full-thickness burns") affect all the layers of tissue. Because the burn goes through the skin, the muscles, nerves, and bones in the area may also be affected. As a result of this dramatic experience and pain, fainting is also really common. Blisters can occur as second degree burns around the third degree burn, but is not a symptom of a third degree burn.
 For a third degree burn, it is always important to put a sterile dressing over the wound for decreased risk of infection. Toes and fingers should also be separated if affected as contact between each other while moving can be very painful. This is a major injury, so 911 should be called. The wound should never be flushed directly with water. Since this is a deep would and nerve endings can be exposed, this would be extremely painful, therefore only the skin around the third degree burn should be flushed with cool water.
 Sprains and strains both refer to stretching or tearing of a muscle, tendon, or ligament. While a fracture occurs when part of a bone is broken. As a result of these injuries, they cause inflammation (swelling), can cause bruising (internal bleeding), and pain that extends above or below the injury.
 Although a sprain is caused by a torn muscle or ligament, it can also be caused by stretching of a muscle. These soft-tissue injuries (injuries to muscles, tendons, or ligaments) can occur during physical activity or by trauma (falls, hits, etc.).
 Closed fractures are breaks in a bone. Undisplaced closed fractures are like cracks in a teacup-there is a break in the surface but not in the alignment. Undisplaced fractures can be distinguished from sprains only on x-rays. Displaced fractures are fractures in which there�s a break in the surface and in alignment.
 Open fractures are displaced fractures in which a bone protrudes and breaks through the skin. Unless it is absolutely essential (like if it happens in the pool and the victim needs to be moved out), do NOT move victims with this condition-it could cause further muscle and nerve damage to the body.
 A dislocation is an injury in which the bones at a joint are displaced from their usual alignment. The joints most commonly dislocated are shoulders, fingers, and toes, but they can also occur in other parts of the body. It is important to NEVER try setting the bone back yourself, only by a trained medical professional.
 It is always important to rest the injured part, to not allow for further injury. Immobilize the injured part in a comfortable position for the least amount of pain. Add cold (ice), to the injured part for 10-15 minutes every hour to decrease swelling, this is a very crucial part in treatment. And also elevate the injured part if it does not hurt to do so, as elevating also decreases swelling.
 Although 911 is encouraged to be called, it does not always have to be considering the situation. If the injury takes place in a non threatening area (like the legs, arms, fingers, toes, etc.) and the victim has a way to get to the hospital (by a parent, guardian, etc.), plus is not experiencing extreme unmanageable pain, then it would be fine for them to get to the hospital themselves. But if these injuries ever happen to the head (risk for concussion or brain hemmorage), back (risk for spinal injury), or neck (also risk for spinal injury), 911 should always be called.
 With the abnormal electrical activity in the brain, it is very common for their to be loss of consciousness in a victim. In addition, with their nerve receptors firing, it is very common to see contractions (�twitching�) all over the body, especially in the arms and legs (most visible in terms of movement). Clenching of the abdomen is also very common in a seizure, therefore can result in the loss of control of the bladder and bowels. Vomiting is a very complex process which requires the stomach to clench, esophagus to open, and trachea to close all at the same time. Therefore, it is very rare to actually see someone vomit (with all these functions somehow occuring at the same time).
 It is always important to clear any surrounding objects that the victim is near as with their excessive movements, they could injure themselves by hitting them. If the victim is in the water, since they do not have the ability to stay afloat, it is important to reach out with your arms and hold only their head above the water, but keep your distance as you could get hit. You must always call 911 for a seizure, in addition with treating them for shock and looking for any other injuries. You should never hold the victim down because immobilizing their movements would put extreme pressure on their bones as their muscles contract, which could lead to fractures.
 Do not put anything in the person's mouth. This can injure teeth or the jaw. A person having a seizure cannot swallow his or her tongue, and actually putting something in their mouth can cause them to choke, which is a major issue as they cannot be treated while seizing, eventually leading to death from suffocation.
